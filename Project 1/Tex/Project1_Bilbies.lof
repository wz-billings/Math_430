The red lines represent the nullclines from the trivial equilibrium and the pink lines represent the nullclines from the nontrivial equilibrium. Note the cyclical motion around the equilibrium at the intersection of the pink nullclines.}}{2}

While the stability of the equilibria never changes, as the value of \(f\) increases, the relative population of aphids appears to increase as well, indicating that pesticides may be harmful to an IPM setup.}}{6}
